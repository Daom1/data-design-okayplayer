				<p>When I look at Okayplayer.com I imagine a multigenerationalist who has a hunger for various musical and entertainment types. I imagine someone who likes to feed their senses with news feeds, audio and videos. I imagine someone who has an opinion and is reactive to what is digested. This person is a professional who uses a variety of mediums of technology. This busy professional keeps their cool in all stressful situations and likes to use the site to keep up with the latest our site has to offer.</p>
